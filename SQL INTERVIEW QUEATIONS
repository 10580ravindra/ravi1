A.The actual difference between rowid and rownum is, that rowid is a permanent unique identifier for that row. However, the rownum is temporary. If you change your query, the rownum number will refer to another row, the rowid won't. So the ROWNUM is a consecutive number which applicable for a specific SQL statement only.
